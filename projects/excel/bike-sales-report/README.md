# Bike Sales Report
Superstore Sales Report 📊

The Bike Store Manager has requested an analytical report based on the dataset provided. My task was to analyze the data, generate meaningful insights, and build an interactive dashboard in Excel to present my findings effectively.

📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains transactional and demographical sales data, including marital status, income, customers, and purchase of bike details.
Using Excel, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the dataset to highlight:

Sales performance based on income level

Profitability trends across occupations and marital status

Regional contributions to total revenue
